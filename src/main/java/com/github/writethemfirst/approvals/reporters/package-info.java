/**
 * # Reporters
 *
 * *Approval Testing* relies on the principle of comparing the program's output with some content stored in files.
 *
 * In case of any differences found during those comparisons, actions should be taken: it can fial the tests, or trigger
 * some other actions the developers choose. Like writing some logs, or reporting it some other way.
 *
 * Additionally, *Approvals-Java* aims at providing some integration with *diff & merge* tools to help developers
 * reviewing their programs' outputs, and easily generate those precious *approved* files.
 *
 * That whole mechanism is handled by Reporters, which are registered to the framework and are then called and triggered
 * in case differences are found while computing the files comparisons.
 *
 * That package aims at containing all the default Reporters (which are not OS dependent).
