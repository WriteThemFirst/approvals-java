/**
 * # ApprovalFiles
 *
 * *Approval Testing* relies on 2 specific files for storing the execution results of the *Program Under Tests* and
 * running comparisons over the output of the program.
 *
 * *Approvals-Java* provides various features, including being able to approve single files, but also to validate the
 * output of a program using an approved folder (which can then contain various sub-folders and files).
 *
 * This class allows to store references of the 2 particular entries to consider: the *approved* and *received* entries,
 * which are used to store the reference data, and the temporary output of the program for comparison. The class manages
 * both cases provided by the framework: single files, or complete folders.
 *
 * This class not only will hold the references of the *approved* and *received* entries, but it'll also provide all the
 * necessary methods allowing to compare and validate the files or folders.
