/**
 * # ApprovalsFiles
 *
 * *Approval Testing* relies on comparing data produced by a *Program Under Tests* and data which has been reviewed and
 * validated by the developer. This validated data is stored in *approved* files along with the project, and is used for
 * comparisons with the data produced by the program's execution.
 *
 * Two files are needed for computing *Approval Tests*: an *approved* file, which should be committed with the source
 * code, containing data validated by the developer, and a *received* file, which temporarily holds the data produced by
 * the *Program Under Tests* execution. Those files are then compared to validate the proper behavior of the program.
 *
 * That `ApprovalsFiles` class can be seen as a wrapper of the *approved* and *received* files for a particular {@link
 * Approbation} since they allow to manage both files for a particular class and method. That wrapper class will provide
 * all the necessary methods to manage the approbation files.
 *
 * `ApprovalsFiles` won't automatically name the files but will only rely on the folder and methodName arguments it
 * received while being created.
