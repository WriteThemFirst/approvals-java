/**
 * # Approvers Package
 *
 * *Approvals-Java* allows to approve your test data from different ways.
 *
 * It allows you to simply validate the output of a Program execution, but it can also let you approve a whole folder
 * content, or even run multiple times your program by computing combinations over all its inputs, and then generate a
 * complete output of the execution to be reviewed.
 *
 * That package contains all the *Approver* objects which are used in order to actually compute the approbations over
 * your test data.
