/**
 * # Functions Package
 *
 * That package contains interfaces representing functions in Java. Those `FunctionX` interfaces can be used as
 * shortcuts in order to declare and use functions with X parameters. It is way easier to remember and use than using
 * objects available natively in Java such as `Callable`, `BiFunction` and such.
 *
 * That package should only contain interfaces easing the usage of functions and lambdas within the framework.
