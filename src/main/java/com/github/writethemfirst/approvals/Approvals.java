/**
 * # Approvals
 *
 * *Approval Testing* is a way of considering Unit Tests without focusing on writing tons of assertions, but by letting
 * the framework generate the references to use in assertions.
 *
 * `Approvals` is this framework's main entry point for validation of data produced by your program, by comparing it to
 * data you already reviewed and approved manually.
 *
 * Using `Approvals` for checking your program's data will actually trigger a comparison between the output it produces,
 * and content stored in a file somewhere in your project's tests. If that file doesn't exist, the framework will warn
 * you and propose you to review the data produced by your program to approve (or not) what has been generated. After
 * you reviewed it and selected the proper output, it'll use the resulting file for future comparisons.
 *
 * An `Approvals` object can be constructed with:
 *
 * - a {@link Class} to be linked with the object. It is used in order to automatically compute the path and name of the
 * *approved* files, used to store the output data of your program.
 *
 * - a {@link Reporter}, to be used if differences are found between your program's output and the *approved* file's
 * content. Some `Reporter`s are provided by the framework, but you can also provide your own.
 *
 * The basic and main entry point you should have a look at in this `Approvals` class is the {@link
 * Approvals#verify(Object)} method, allowing to compute a comparison between an output and some content stored in an
 * *approved* file.
