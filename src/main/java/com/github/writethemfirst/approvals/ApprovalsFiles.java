/**
 * # ApprovalsFiles
 *
 * *Approval Testing* relies on comparing data produced by a *Program Under Tests* and data which has been reviewed and
 * validated by the developer. This validated data is stored in *approved* files along with the project, and is used for
 * comparisons with the data produced by the program's execution.
 *
 * Two files are needed for computing *Approval Tests*: an *approved* file, which should be committed with the source
 * code, containing data validated by the developer, and a *received* file, which temporarily holds the data produced by
 * the *Program Under Tests* execution. Those files are then compared to validate the proper behavior of the program.
 *
 * That `ApprovalsFiles` class can be seen as a companion to a test class since it provides useful methods allowing to
 * read and write both *approved* and *received* files. It is linked to a test class since the produced files will be
 * named after the test class and its methods.
 *
 * An `ApprovalsFiles` object will be automatically created and attached to any created `Approvals` object, but you may
 * choose to instantiate one yourself for accessing and managing the *approved* and *received* files of a particular
 * class.
